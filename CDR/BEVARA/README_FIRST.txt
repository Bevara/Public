CDR needs a number of libraries, some are here at the top level. 
A modified version of librevenge that includes an RGBA output
is under libcdr. 

CDR is currently in beta stage, there is still some 
local memory allocation within the RBGA librevenge routines
to be removed after testing. 

Use at your own risk, not all corner cases are implemented
and or tested! We will update as development continues, so 
please check back frequently.
