Bevara Accessors are inspired by or based on open-source data decoders/interpreters/applications. Thus, they 
inherit the licenses from the original applications. 

Each directory contains two subdirectories: ORIGINAL which contains the original code modified by Bevara; and,
BEVARA which contains Bevara's version of the code. Please see the license files in the original and the
embedded license information in the Bevara code for information about the license for each format.
